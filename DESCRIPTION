Description: Provides functional tools such as `fmap()`, `fwalk()`, and `fapply()` 
    to iterate over vectors, data frames, or grouped data with optional multicore/multisession parallelism 
    and live progress tracking. This package offers seamless integration of side-effect and result-driven operations with support for reproducible
    benchmarking and Monte Carlo workflows.
