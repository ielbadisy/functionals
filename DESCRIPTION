Description: Provides functional tools such as fmap(), fwalk(), and fapply() 
    to iterate over vectors, data frames, or grouped data with optional parallelism 
    and real-time progress tracking. Designed for readable and reproducible workflows, 
    including support for Monte Carlo simulations and benchmarking. Inspired by the 
    functional programming paradigm as popularized in Wickham (2019) 
    <doi:10.1007/s11222-019-09856-2>.
